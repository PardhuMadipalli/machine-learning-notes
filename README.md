# Machine learning notes
*Theoretical and practical concepts of machine learning*

## Reducing overfitting
### Regularization
We penalize the parameters as they become bigger. There are L1 and L2 regularization techniques as mentioned in [this arcticle](https://towardsdatascience.com/l1-and-l2-regularization-methods-ce25e7fc831c).
